### Publish package to npm registry (publish-npm.yaml)

The Publish-npm workflow publishes the package to the npm registry after a new
release is created. It runs on a
[release event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#release)
that has the type `published` and it can also be dispatched manually.

**Notice!** You also need to add the
[npm publish token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens)
as an action secret named NPM_TOKEN in the repository.

You may want to customize the arguments for the publish command depending on
whether the access to your package is public or private. The workflow is
currently configured for publishing a public package. Read more about
publishing of npm packages
[here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-publish) and
[here](https://docs.npmjs.com/). Read more about publishing packages using pnpm
[here](https://pnpm.io/cli/publish).
