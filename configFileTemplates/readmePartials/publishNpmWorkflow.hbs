### Publish package to npm registry (publish-npm.yaml)

The Publish-npm workflow publishes the package to the npm registry after a new
release is created. It runs on a
[release event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#release)
that has the type `published` and it can also be dispatched manually.

**Notice!** You also need to add the
[npm publish token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens)
as an action secret named NPM_TOKEN in the repository.
