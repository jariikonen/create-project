### Automatic release creation with release-please (release-please.yaml)

The Release-please workflow runs the
[googleapis/release-please-action](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action)
which creates release pull requests automatically based on the [conventional
commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). It runs on a push to
the main branch and it can also be dispatched manually.

The easiest way to start the versioning from a specific version number is to
create an empty commit with `Release-As: <VERSION>` in the message. For
example, like this:

```
git commit --allow-empty -m 'chore: release 0.1.0' -m 'Release-As: 0.1.0'
```

**Notice!** You need to create a Personal Access Token that has read and write
access to code (contents) and pull requests and set it as action secret named
RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN in the repository.
