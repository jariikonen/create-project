## Husky

The template installs Husky Git hook framework. However, it cannot be
configured before Git is initialized. So, you will have to do that after you
have initialized Git.

### Configuration

Run `git init` to initialize git and then run the `prepare` script using your
package manager (e.g., `pnpm run prepare`). This will create directory
`.husky/` into the project root. There is also a pre-commit hook file
(`pre-commit`) in the root of the project directory that you can use by
copying it to the `.husky/` directory.

### Pre-commit hook

The pre-commit hook runs the linter (if you selected ESLint), the tests (if you
selected Vitest), tsc for type checking and checks whether Git's worktree is
empty.
