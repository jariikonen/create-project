## Prettier

The template installs Prettier code formatter and if ESLint is
selected, it is also configured to work with it using eslint-config-prettier.
There is also a basic .prettierrc.json file that sets quotes as single and a
.prettierignore file. Read more about Prettier [here](https://prettier.io/docs/)
and eslint-config-prettier
[here](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier#readme) and
[here](https://prettier.io/docs/integrating-with-linters).
